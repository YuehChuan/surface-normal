# surface-normal
This is a rewrite of [JiaxiongQ/surface-normal](https://github.com/JiaxiongQ/surface-normal) â€“
a data preprocessing tool for [JiaxiongQ/DeepLiDAR](https://github.com/JiaxiongQ/DeepLiDAR).

The `calplanenormal()` from the original code is provided as a setup.py-installable Python
library with a single function: `surface_normal.normals_from_depth`.

## Setup

Build and install the library. Requires CMake and OpenCV. 
```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Takes a depth image (such as the ones provided with the [KITTI depth completion dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_completion))
as input and outputs estimated normals as an RGB image.
The scale of the depth values does not matter.

```python
from surface_normal import normals_from_depth

# Camera intrinsics
f  = 721.5377
cx = 609.5593
cy = 172.8540
normals_from_depth("depth.png", "normals.png",
    intrinsics=(f, cx, cy),
    window_size=15,
    max_rel_depth_diff=0.1
)
```

### Depth input example 

![depth](depth.png)

### Normals output
![normals](normals.png)
